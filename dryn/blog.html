                <h1>Remembering South Africa's "Grand Greek" Barry Dwolatzky - engineering and programming pioneer</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="blog__details">
                <p>
                    To some of his former students, Professor Barry Dwolatzky was the "Grand Geek" - a name of which he
                    was very proud. But Barry, who passed away in Johannesburg, South Africa on 16 May 2023, was much
                    more than a computer geek. He was also a leader and a visionary in the field of software engineering
                    in South Africa. At the time of his passing he was 71 years old. He was by then retired from
                    academia and held the title of Emeritus Professor at the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits),
                    where he spent much of his career.
                    But he didn't really slow down: he remained the director of the Joburg Centre for Software
                    Engineering (JCSE), a role he'd held since 2007. During the COVID lockdown in 2020, he started a
                    podcast called Optimizing - Leading Africa's Digital Future and produced eight episodes. He also
                    wrote an autobiography called Coded History - My Life of New Beginnings, which was launched in
                    November 2022.
                    A pioneer in programming
                    An alumnus of the School of Electrical and Information Engineering at Wits University, Barry
                    graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering in 1975. He then started a master's
                    degree, which he converted to a PhD.
                    After obtaining his PhD in 1979, he did post-doctoral research at the University of Manchester's
                    Institute of Science and Technology and at Imperial College in London. Thereafter, he worked as a
                    senior research associate at the GEC- Marconi Centre in the UK...
